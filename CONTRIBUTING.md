### 1. Edit the file

3. Make the changes to the file. Try to keep them as short as possible and do not try to addnew factors along with other factors updates. Try to do both in separate requests.
4. Save or export the file as a `.csv` file separated by commas.
5. Open the `csv` file with a text editor (Right-click on the file > Open With... > TextEdit in Mac or Notepad in Windows).
6. Copy the content of the file.
7. Back to GitHub, click on `OpenEmissionFactorsDB.csv` file and then in the edit icon.
8. Paste the content in the text area.
